dockerfile.vim
==============

Syntax highlighting for Dockerfiles.

Got it from Docker repro (they got it from
<https://github.com/honza/dockerfile.vim>). However, their setting didn't work
for me.

Installation
------------

With [Vundle](https://github.com/gmarik/Vundle.vim)
  
    Plugin 'docker/docker'

Features
--------

The syntax highlighting includes:

* The directives (e.g. `FROM`)
* Strings
* Comments

License
-------

BSD, short and sweet
